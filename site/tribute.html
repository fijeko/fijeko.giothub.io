    <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>

    <blockquote cite="http://lipsum.com/">
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type
    and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
    It has survived not only five centuries,
    but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
    remaining essentially unchanged.
    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
    containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
    including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    <h3>HISTORY</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li><span>1st-century Latin text by Cicero</span>
            The lorem ipsum text is a scrambled section of <cite>De finibus bonorum et malorum</cite>, 
            with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper Latin.
        </li>
        <li><span>1914</span>
            gallery type of page 36 from Loeb Classical Library Edition of
            <q>De Finibus..</q>  was mixed up to make the dummy text seen today
        </li>
        <li><span>1960s or earlier</span>
            It was popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets.
        </li>
        <li><span>mid-1980s</span>
            It was introduced to the Information Age by <q>Aldus Corporation</q>, 
            in word processing templates for its <q>PageMaker program</q>.

    <h2>Why to use Lorem Ipsums?</h2>
    
    <p>It is a good initial context to fill in a page wireframe.</p>
    
    <blockquote cite="http://zurb.com/word/lorem-ipsum">
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted
        by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
        The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has
        a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
        as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',
        making it look like readable English.
        <span> .... </span>
        Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
        sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

    <h2>Why not to use Lorem Ipsums?</h2>

    <blockquote cite="http://zurb.com/word/lorem-ipsum">
        Lorem ipsum is a cheap substitute for the real thing:
        meaningful, compelling text that drives your website.
        However, the problem is that so many designers seem to forget that.
        The primary purpose of a designer is to convey content
        in an innovative and visually compelling way.
        And it’s kind of hard to do this when you don’t even know what your content is.
        Content should drive design, not the other way around.

        Yes, every time you use lorem ipsum in your designs,
        you’re basically quoting Cicero talking about masochism.
        I suppose if you’re designing a weird, Latin-based Tinder,
        then maybe that lorem ipsum excerpt would be comically accurate,
        but otherwise you’re probably missing the mark.
        Needless to say, maybe it’s time to give your dummy text an upgrade.
